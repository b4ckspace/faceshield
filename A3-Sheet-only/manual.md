# Face shield from one single A3 sheet

With the Covid-19 outbreak there are multiple projects that provide a face shield. Bu tthey often rely on 3D printed or laser cut parts that are not available to every one. These instruction allow to build a decent face shield from just office supplies. While maybe not as fancy it still provides good protection, is stable enough and provides good comfort. It is also probably one of the lightest face shields available.

You need:

* Transparent A3 sheet about 0.2mm thick
* Ruler
* Scissors
* Knife
* Stapler
* Tape

Instructions:

* Cut sheet as shown in the SVG
* Fold both 4cm stripes along their length
* Then overlap them for a few centimeters and join them with two staples
* Put the thin 2cm stripe through the 2cm slits in the middle.
  * Secure with a bit of tape as shown
  * The side with the tape is now the outside
* Staple the strip inside to the left where shown with two or three 
  * Have the staples joining the stripes right inside of the staple area
  * Make sure the strip is parallel to the top and bottom edge
* Staple the strip to the right side but make the strip 8 cm shorter than the shield
  * The sides of the shild should bend backward
* Bend the top of the sheet at the 4cm cuts so the sides and the top bend inwards
  * Make sure the 4x4cm tab is on the inside
  * Let the corners of the outside parts touch
  * Then secure with a piece of tape
  * Do the same for the other side
* Bend the 2cm strip into a loop that keeps the shield about 2cm from the strap
  * Staple the loop to the strap
* Put on the mask and adjust the length of the strap
* You can now either:
  * Secure it with one staple
* or
  * Make 5mm shorter
  * Punch a hole through both straps
  * Secure with a paper clip 

You are done! Stay healthy!
