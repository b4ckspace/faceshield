# Creating The Right Hole Patterns

Version 1 and 2 are both supporting A4 and A3 sheets. But other sizes can also be used if given the right hole patterns. The basic pattern we use is called 888 or 3x8 and is supported on most Euro hole punchers. This is a pattern of 4 holes with 80mm distance center to center. There are a lot of ways to achive this pattern - depending on the equippement at hand.

## 4 Hole punch

If you need a lot of sheets (e.g. you want to change them often) get a normal 4 hole punch. They are cheap and create the pattern right away.

## Normal 2 Hole Punch With Side Stop

Many hole punchers have an adjustable side stop that does have an 888 or 3x8 setting. You can just use this setting from both sides of the page to get the 4 holes all with the same distance. This **only works** for sheets that are **exaclty A4** in size!

## Measure

You can use a ruler to find the right place to punch the holes. As normal hole punchers typically have a mark for the center of the page you can just mark the spots 80mm left and righ of the page center and align your hole punch there. This has the benefit of also working with sheets that are not 297mm long (A4 landscape)

## Double punch!

If you just have a normal hole punch you can try this:

* Mark the middle of the page
* Punch the center holes
* Use the holes as new centers
* Use the new outer holes as new centers

This gives you a row of holes 40mm apart. Some of them are punched twice. You need to be pretty precise for this to work. Check if the double holes are not missaligned

## A3 Sheets

For the A3 we use the (fictional) 88888 pattern. It is the 888 pattern from above plus two more holes that are also 80mm further out. If you want to use A3 sheets you really should get a 4 hole punch, but you can also use any other methods above - except using a side stop.

The outer holes would be 10mm in from the sides. We moved hooks inward a bit so holes with about 11mm from the sides also work. That way you can just turn you hole punch around and use it from the sides. The hole should be about the same distance from above.

# Other Holders

Note that not everyone is using this pattern. Some 3D printed shields use a 80mm-68.5mm-80mm pattern. It is created by using the A6 side stop settings from both sides on an A4 sheet.

Our design currently does not support this hole pattern. But it can be added easily. Please open a ticket if you are interested.

# Cutting To Shape

All sheets need to be cut into shape to allow head movement. A4 can be used uncut, but is much more comfortable if the lower corners are clipped. A4 sheets offer just enough protection for many use cases.

A3 sheets offer much better protection. But if used in their full size are just too big and don't let enough fresh air in. They need to be cut to size. You want to cut off the bottom corners up to the top edge and probably even shorten it at the bottom. It is difficult to give general advice here as all use cases are different.
