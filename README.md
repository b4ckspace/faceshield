# Lasercut Face Shield

Due to the Covid-19 outbreak there is an increased need for face protection for health care professionals and many others. There are multiple projects that are trying to offer make shift solutions. This is ours.

Our face shield is laser cut which allows producing lots of shields quickly. We are currently planning to use polycarbonate or PETG. What make our approach different is that we are not cutting the actual shield but use off the shelf A4 or A3 transparency sheets. That way the laser cut pieces can be reused multiple times while only replacing the transparency shield. This is not a new idea but other project offering this feature are all 3D printed which limits the output.

The sheet is attached with standard pattern holes that can be created with a normal 80mm, Euro pattern hole puncher. Support for 888 patterns or full 4 hole punchers are of benefit.

## Status

We just started. First prototypes look promising but we are still in the process of acquiring the proper materials. Expect updates the next days.
